A program which shows how to apply the concept of logarithms in exponential population growth.

Uses graph theory to allow the user to set up a pattern of nodes (cities) and edges (roads) along with infection points.
After setting up the graph, the program will ask the user various questions about exponential population growth, related to the
graph and its properties.

This is still a work in progress, as I haven't had much time to work on it recently...Here is a screenshot!
